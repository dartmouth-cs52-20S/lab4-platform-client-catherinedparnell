## Lab 4
I made a redux 'blog' application to hold character personas of funny animal gifs that my friends helped write. You can see the whole 'squad' on the meet slide, and the create a post on the 'join' the squad slide. I decided to use Material-UI for styling so I could learn how it works. Material-UI was finicky, and I ended up spending more time on trying to get it to my liking than the bulk of the assignment. I was unable to separate out the tags into separate chips because of problems with the asynchronocity of the functions, but I hope to fix that up for the next lab. I hope to also add filterabiliy to those tags. It might be cool to add a few other pages in there as well. Excited to keep working on it.

## Lab 5 Part II
Now the blog can hold user authentication. Users can sign up, make an account, begin creating posts, and sign out/sign in again. The author name and username are displayed along with each post. More info is provided in the api readme. **Extra credit:** Users can only edit posts that they themselves create.
