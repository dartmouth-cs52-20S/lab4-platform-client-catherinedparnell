I made a 'blog' type application to hold character personas of funny animal gifs that my friends helped write. You can see the whole 'squad' on the meet slide, and the create a post on the 'join' the squad slide. I decided to use Material-UI for styling so I could learn how it works. Material-UI was finicky, and I ended up spending more time on trying to get it to my liking than the bulk of the assignment. I was unable to separate out the tags into separate chips because of problems with the asynchronocity of the functions, but I hope to fix that up for the next lab.
